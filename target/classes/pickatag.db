"551","CARTOON LAWS OF PHYSICS I: \par\par Any body suspended in space will remain in space until made aware of it's situation. \par\par Daffy Duck steps off a cliff, expecting further pastureland.  He loiters in midair, soliloquizing flippantly, until he chances to look down. At this point, the familiar principle of 32 feet per second takes over."
"552","CARTOON LAWS OF PHYSICS II: \par\par Any body in motion will tend to remain in motion until solid matter intervenes suddenly."
"553","CARTOON LAWS OF PHYSICS III: \par\par Any body passing through solid matter will leave a perforation conforming to it's perimeter. \par\par Also called the silhouette of passage, this phenomenon is the specialty of victims of direct-pressure explosions and reckless cowards who are so eager to escape that they exit directly through the wall of a house, leaving a cookie-cutout perfect hole.  The threat of skunks or matrimony often catalyzes this reaction."
"554","CARTOON LAWS OF PHYSICS IV: \par\par The time required for an object to fall twenty stories is greater than or equal to the time it takes for whoever knocked it off the ledge to spiral down twenty flights to attempt to capture it unbroken."
"555","CARTOON LAWS OF PHYSICS V: \par\par All principles of gravity are negated by fear. \par\par Pshychic forces are sufficient in most bodies for a shock to propel them directly away from the earth's surface.  A spooky noise or an adversary's signature sound will induce motion upward, usually to the cradle of a chandlier, a treetop, or the crest of a flagpole. The feet of a character who is running or the wheels of a speeding auto need never touch the ground, especially when in flight."
"556","CARTOON LAWS OF PHYSICS VI: \par\par As speed increases, objects can be in several places at once. \par This is particularly true of tooth and claw fights, in which a character's head may be glimpsed emerging from the cloud of altercation at several place"
"557","CARTOON LAWS OF PHYSICS VII: \par\par Certain bodies can pass through solid walls painted to resemble tunnel entrances, others cannot."
"558","CARTOON LAWS OF PHYSICS VIII: \par\par A violent rearrangement of feline matter is impermanent. \par Corollary: A cat will assume the shape of it's container."

"560","CARTOON LAWS OF PHYSICS X: \par\par For every vengeance there is an equal and opposite revengeance."
"561","CARTOON LAWS OF PHYSICS Amendment A: \par\par A sharp object will always propel a character upaward. \par When poked (usually in the buttocks) with a sharp object (usually a pin) a character will defy gravity by shooting straight up, with great velocity."
"562","CARTOON LAWS OF PHYSICS Amendment B: \par\par The laws of object permanence are nullified for 'cool' characters. \par For instance, the road runner can materialize signs to express himself without speaking."
"563","CARTOON LAWS OF PHYSICS Amendment C: \par\par Explosive weapons cannot cause fatal injuries.  They merely turn characters temporarily black and smoky."
